# BraveNewWorkshop
Mod for computer game [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/), It adds a machine to the game to allow players to craft items that can normally only be crafted by hand. 
This allows the crafting of these items while no player is present like in certain rts based mods like [Brave new world](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/brave-new-world) or [Von Neumann](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vonNeumann)
